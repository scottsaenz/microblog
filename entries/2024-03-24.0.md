# Initial Entry 2024-03-24.0
My motivation for creating a micro-blogging site is to document different technologies that I am learning. 
Documentating and implementing new things I'm learning gives me a one-stop-shop for when I inevitably have to go back and re-learn something. 
## Technologies that I think I'll use
- AWS for hosting
- Terraform for creating the services on AWS
- Python for the coding portion
- CI/CD within Github

## Steps to get there
1. Figure out the code needed for creating a microblogging site
   1. This will inform what AWS services are needed
2. Get site working locally
3. Determine what AWS services are needed - highly influenced on a relatively small budget
4. Write terraform for creating/destroying services
   1. blog posts should be retained (small amount of money to store them)
5. Determine IAM policy needed for github CI/CD pipeline to push everything to AWS
6. Celebrate/focus on next thing
