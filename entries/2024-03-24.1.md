# Start of Microblogging Research
No sense in trying to recreate the wheel, so I'm going to use [The New And Improved Flask Mega-Tutorial (2024 Edition)](https://a.co/d/3ZMRJBa) from Miguel Grinberg as a guide. 

## Initial thoughts
Like many software devs, Miguel recommends working on a UNIX type system. This is due to most of the web also runs on UNIX, so it makes sense to have a local env that mirrors the web as much as possible.\
Time to dust off my limited knowledge on how to use WSL.\
[Intro to WSL](https:///learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/wsl-introduction/) provided everything I needed to connect from VS Code on Windows to the git location on WSL.\
The version of python was a little outdated, so I followed [these](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/upgrade-python) upgrade instructions. I opted for 3.12 since that is the latest lambda runtime in AWS.\
Running `python3 --version` still displays `3.10`, so time to delve into why; I'm thinking it has to do with `PATH`\
I could not manually update the `PATH` so I went with homebrew instead\
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
(echo; echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /home/scottsaenz/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
sudo apt-get install build-essential
brew install gcc
brew install python@3.12
```
Running `python3 --version` finally shows `3.12.2`

Now I can create the virtual env need for poetry

## Virtual Env for Python
I'm a firm believer in having a separate env for each project I'm working on. Deviating from this approach can lead to package incompatabilities between different projects that will be a mess to untangle.\
I've previously used conda envs to create new ones, but have heard good things about using poetry. I have not used it before, but decided what's one more thing to add on to a project ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\

Installing poetry with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/)
- Dependent on Ubuntu version. Running `lsb_release -a` tells you what version of Ubuntu you are on, which could determine pipx installation
