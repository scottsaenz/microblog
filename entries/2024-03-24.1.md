# Start of Microblogging Research
No sense in trying to recreate the wheel, so I'm going to use [The New And Improved Flask Mega-Tutorial (2024 Edition)](https://a.co/d/3ZMRJBa) from Miguel Grinberg as a guide. 

## Initial thoughts
Like many software devs, Miguel recommends working on a UNIX type system. This is due to most of the web also runs on UNIX, so it makes sense to have a local env that mirrors the web as much as possible.\
Time to dust off my limited knowledge on how to use WSL. Ideally I can also use VS Code within WSL, but maybe I'll look into SSH.
